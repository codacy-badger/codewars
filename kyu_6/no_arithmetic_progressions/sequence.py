def sequence(n: int) -> int:
    """
    A function f(n), which returns the n-th member of sequence.

    Consider a sequence, which is formed by the following rule:
    next term is taken as the smallest possible non-negative integer,
    which is not yet in the sequence, so that no 3 terms of sequence
    form an arithmetic progression.

    Example:
        f(0) = 0 -- smallest non-negative
        f(1) = 1 -- smallest non-negative, which is not yet in the sequence
        f(2) = 3 -- since 0, 1, 2 form an arithmetic progression
        f(3) = 4 -- neither of 0, 1, 4, 0, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4 form an arithmetic
                    progression, so we can take smallest non-negative, which is larger than 3
        f(4) = 9 -- 5, 6, 7, 8 are not good, since 1, 3, 5, 0, 3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 0, 4, 8
                    are all valid arithmetic progressions.
