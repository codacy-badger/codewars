		Testing growing_plant function

		Task

		Each day a plant is growing by upSpeed meters.
		Each night that plant's height decreases by downSpeed
		meters due to the lack of sun heat. Initially, plant
		is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning
		of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant
		will reach a certain level.

		Example

		For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10 and desiredHeight = 910,
		the output should be 10.

		For upSpeed = 10, downSpeed = 9 and desiredHeight = 4,
		the output should be 1. Because the plant reach to the desired
		height at day 1(10 meters).

		Input/Output

		[input] integer upSpeed
		A positive integer representing the daily growth.
		Constraints: 5 ≤ upSpeed ≤ 100.

		[input] integer downSpeed
		A positive integer representing the nightly decline.
		Constraints: 2 ≤ downSpeed < upSpeed.

		[input] integer desiredHeight
		A positive integer representing the threshold.
		Constraints: 4 ≤ desiredHeight ≤ 1000.

		[output] an integer

		The number of days that it will take for the plant to
		reach/pass desiredHeight (including the last day in the
		total count).
