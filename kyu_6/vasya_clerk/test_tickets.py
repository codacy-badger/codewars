		Testing tickets function with various test inputs.

		The new "Avengers" movie has just been released!
		There are a lot of people at the cinema box office
		standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single
		100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket
		costs 25 dollars.

		Vasya is currently working as a clerk.
		He wants to sell a ticket to every single person
		in this line.

		Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change
		if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly
		in the order people queue?

		The function should return YES, if Vasya can sell
		a ticket to every person and give change with the
		bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.
