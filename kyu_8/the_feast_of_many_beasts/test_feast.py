		Testing 'feast' function with various test inputs

		name and dish as arguments and returns true or
		false to indicate whether the beast is allowed
		to bring the dish to the feast.

		Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings,
		and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish
		may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear
		at the beginning or end of the string. They will not
		contain numerals.

		There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with
		the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the
		great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee
		is bringing chocolate cake.
